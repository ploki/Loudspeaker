Loudspeaker is an online loudspeaker graphing calculator
for libapache2-mod-raii which permits to simulate drivers
in different kind of enclosures like bass-reflex, push-pull,
sealed enclosures and TQWP (like accoustic lines).

Graphical representations are made with the libapache2-mod-raii
Cairo binding which is transactionnal.

But when doing enclosures yourself...
... Do never forget the Ray's Rule of Precision:
   Measure with a micrometer.  Mark with chalk.  Cut with an axe.
